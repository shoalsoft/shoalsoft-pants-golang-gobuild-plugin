# Pantsbuild Go Plugin

## Overview

This is a plugin for the [Pantsbuild](https://pantsbuild.org) build orchestration tool to build Go sources using the higher-level `go build` command instead of the invoking the lower level `go tool compile` command as the current Pants Go backend does.

This plugin is still under development and is **experimental** at best, **bleeding edge** at worst.


## Licensing

This plugin is not currently open source. See the included [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for particulars.
